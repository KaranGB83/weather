# weather.py
This Python file is a command-line tool that retrieves and displays current weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It performs the following tasks:
Accepts a city name as input via command-line arguments.
Sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.
Parses the JSON response to extract key weather details:
-Temperature (in Celsius)
-Humidity percentage
-Weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain")
-Country code
-Sunrise and sunset times (converted to UTC format)
Handles errors gracefully, including:
-Network issues
-Invalid city names
-Missing data in the API response
Returns the weather data as a dictionary for further use or display.

# app.py
Flask web application that allows users to search for real-time weather information by city name. It integrates the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and uses SQLite3 for user management and persistent search logging.

--Users can enter a city name to retrieve current temperature, humidity, weather description, and sunrise/sunset times.

--Secure login, logout, and registration system using hashed passwords with Werkzeug.

--Logged-in users have their weather searches saved and can view recent queries.

--Tracks logged-in users and restricts access to history and account pages.

--Provides real-time feedback for errors, login status, and form validation.

--Stores user credentials and weather search history in a local database.

# requirements.txt
flask: The main web framework used to build the server, handle routing, render templates, and manage sessions.

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather data.

werkzeug: Provides secure password hashing and verification utilities for user authentication.

pysqlite3: Enables interaction with a local SQLite database to store user credentials and weather search history.

# weather.db

The weather.db file is a SQLite database that stores user credentials and weather search history for Flask-based weather application.

sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, hash NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq);
CREATE TABLE history (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,user_id INTEGER,city TEXT,time DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id));
# layout.html
